### Project: **React+TypeScript Cheatsheets**

This project is based on [this website](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/).

Materials that I have used to build this website:

* React

* TypeScript

* Tailwind CSS (this is the best, I swear)

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is just a practice homework.
